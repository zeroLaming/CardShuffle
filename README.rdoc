== Card shuffle

Challenge:

Write a Rails app that allows users to shuffle a deck of cards and presents the result.

Main problems:

1. Generating 52 cards in an elegant, easy to understand fashion.

A deck consists of cards 2 - 10, plus a Jack, Queen, King and an Ace.

2. Card duplication

We need to ensure that the the deck we produce doesn't have any duplicates.

3. Shuffling

We need to ensure that when we shuffle the deck the result is convincingly random.


Solution:

I'm not ashamed to admit I googled potential solutions for inspiration (as I would do for any real world problem), and two things jumped out at me:

1. Mapping the numbers 0 - 51 to cards guarantees their uniqueness, and

2. Making use of Array#shuffle makes a lot of sense for creating random decks.

A solution outlined here (http://stackoverflow.com/a/2641421) elegantly solves the problem, so I've borrowed parts of it.
